// we are building a new ui for tracking habits weekly
// we need a tab at the top to switch between daily and weekly habits view
// we just need to render a list of habits that we have
// each list / div has 8 cols
// - the first col is the habit name
// - and from second to last col is the day of the week
// - each day of the week is a checkbox
// - on click we call the toggle function
// - the toggle function will take the habit name and the day of the week

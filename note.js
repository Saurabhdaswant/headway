// UI enhancements: Continually improve your UI based on user feedback and the latest design trends.
// For instance, you could add a dark mode, create a more intuitive onboarding process, or provide more customization options for the users.

// Performance: Ensure the app loads quickly, runs smoothly, and is optimized for different devices. React's virtual DOM
//  provides opportunities for fine-tuning performance that can make a significant difference.

// Accessibility: Make sure your app is accessible to users with disabilities. This can involve providing alternative text for
// images, ensuring good contrast between text and background, and making sure the app can be fully used with a keyboard.

// Social Features: Allowing users to share their progress, join groups, or compete in challenges could make the app more engaging.

// Notifications and Reminders: Users could benefit from customizable reminders about their habits. You could also use notifications
// to celebrate milestones or suggest new habits based on their progress.
